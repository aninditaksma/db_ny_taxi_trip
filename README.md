## Description
The dashboard was made particularly to present the overview of the first quarter of the year 2020. It shows numbers of total trips, revenue, passengers, and tips given by passengers. I also included the average of these numbers right beneath. One and only time series chart shown is to show that from January to mid of March, the graph ups and downs steadily to decrease slowly afterwards to the end of quarter.

The first pie chart tells which payment method the passengers would likely to do; credit card, while cash comes second. Another pie chart tells the most final rate code in effect at the end of the trip.

A bar chart standing on the right visualizes which borough are the passengers mostly get picked up.
